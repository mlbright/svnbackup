svn backup
==========

Script to backup your svn repositories to compressed files.

Current state of affairs
========================

svn-backup.sh and svn-remote-backup.py work nicely, and have been used in production environments.

second python version (svn-remote-backup2.py) is not tested significantly: 
do not use this in production ... yet. It will be sweet when complete.
